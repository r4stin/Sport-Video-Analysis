# Sport Video Analysis for Billiard Matches
This project aims to develop a computer vision system for analyzing video footage of "Eight Ball" billiard games. The system will leverage computer vision techniques to provide real-time insights into the game's state, including ball positions, trajectories, and game progress. The output will be visualized as a 2D top-view minimap of the playing field.
